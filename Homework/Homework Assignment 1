Homework Assignment #1

* Name of company
	
Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)

* When was the company incorporated?
Square was incorporated in February 2009 in St. Louis, MI and is currently headquartered in San Francisco, CA.

* Who are the founders of the company?
The founders of Square are Jack Dorsey, Jim McKelvey, and Tristan O'Tierney.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The genesis of Square occurred to Jack Dorsey when his friend and fellow founder Jim McKelvey was attempting to sell his glass faucet and fittings but was unable to complete the sale because he was unable to accept credit cards for payment.  
Jack Dorsey discovered a void in options for credit card payments for peer to peer and small business transactions.  Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey developed Square out of a small office in St. Louis, MO.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Square received an initial $42M private placement in 2011 by Visa with additional series C ($103M in 2011), D ($200M in 2012), E ($150M in 2014) funding.  
The company received a pre-money valuation of $5.9B after the series E funding, which was led by GIC Special Investments, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Goldman Sachs on October 5, 2014.
Square later filed for an IPO in October 2015 offering 31M shares at a price of $9 per share, equating to net equity proceeds to the company of $219M.
Since its IPO, Square has been able to fund itself from cash flow from operations ($322M LTM 9/30/20).  It has a current capital structure (as of 9/30/20) consisting of $474M in revolving credit and $2B in senior secured bonds with additional undrawn revolving credit facility of $526M.  


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Square was founded to provide cashless tractions, predominantly amongst peer to peer and small business transactions that would not otherwise have access to expensive credit card transactions and cash requirements.
The Company continues to refine and expand its service offering including sending/accepting invoice payments, providing small loans that are collateralized and paid back from future sales, payroll management, and food delivery service.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Square's primary customers are small businesses ("Sellers") that are enabled to utilize credit/debit card payments, including Apple Pay or Samsung Pay from their smartphones in exchange for a flat fee per transactions.  
During FY 2019, Square processed approximately 106.2 billion of Gross Payment Volume ("GPV"), that was generated from nearly 2.3 billion card payments from 407 million payment cards.
More recently, Square launched its Cash App, a parallel ecosystem of financial services targeted to individual users ("buyers").  These services were once only accessible to more affluent consumers, however, utilizing technology, the platform is able to allow individuals to store, send, receive, spend, and invest their money.
Cash App had approximately 24 million active customers with at least one cash inflow/outflow per month.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Square has various competitors in the cashless transaction space offering similar standalone service.  However, Square has been able to expand its ecosystem with add-on services that are streamlined and captured on a single dashboard for its customers.  
This makes it easier for current customers to utilize Square's bundled services such as payroll services, project financing, accounting software, and most recently, digital crypto wallets.  
In October 2020, Square announced it had purchased 4,709 bitcoins with a market value at time of purchase of approximately $50M.  Since the launce of the Cash App, users have had the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin and the company has focused a portion of its resources to form Square Crypto.
Square's focus on Bitcoin and its believe in the rapid evolution of cryptocurrency gives it advantageous positioning compared to its direct competitors.
By offering an expanded integrated service offering, Square can retain its customers within its dynamic ecosystem. 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Square uses various technologies in its service offerings with constant developments in its omnichannel commerce, proximity payment devices (contactless payments via NFC technology), with recent developments in cryptocurrencies and in tokenization, which replaces more sensitive card information with symbols (tokens) to protect users' sensitive information.
Some of the more specific technologies used include the following:
-Java Virtual Machine for logging, metrics, and containerization with additional open-source tools
-Postgres, My SQL, Redis, and HDFS for storing data and transient information
-IOS and Android for graphical user interfaces and customer experience

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Square primarily operates in the domain of cashless/contactless card transactions.  Square offers a cohesive commerce ecosystem that allows sellers to start, run, and grow their businesses. 
It includes software, hardware, and additional services to create products/services that are cohesive, fast, intuitive, stable, and provide an easy customer experience. 
Square's cohesive service offering enables it as an industry leader operating in a highly fragmented industry that forces customers to use products and services from various vendors with incompatible technologies and a poor customer experience.


* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Cashless transactions have evolved tremendously over the past 5-10 years.  Prior to Square's founding in 2009, larger financial institutions primarily provided ACH and wire transfers, but they were mainly reserved for B2B uses as the cost and access for peer to peer was difficult. 
Pureplay cashless transactions providers was limited to only Western Union or Money Gram.
  
* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Other major companies in this domain that compete directly with Square include Global Payments (NYSE:GPN), PayPal Holdings (Nasdaq:PYPL), and Fiserv, Inc. (Nasdaq: FISV).  Square offers some payroll processing solutions with competitors including Automatic Data Processing (Nasdaq:ADP) and Paychex (Nasdaq:PAYX).


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Square has experienced tremendous growth since its founding from user adoption and continual expansions in its service offering.  For the LTM September 2020, it had net income of $310M on revenue of $7.6B compared to net income of -$85M on revenue of $203M in FY December 2012 (its first complete year after IPO)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
One of the primary core metrics to measure success is Gross Payment Volume ("GPV"), Square processed $106.2 billion of GPV generated by nearly 2.3 billion card payments from 407 million payment cards.
Another metric within GPV is the number of larger users, defined as annual GPV greater than $125k.  As Squares expanded suite of offerings and complex solutions expands it is positioned to target larger users.
GPV from large users represented 55% of GPV in Q4 2019, an increase of 51% compared to Q4 2018.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Square has experienced exponential growth in recent years; however, it still lags in size compared to its larger competitors such as PayPal and ADP.  
During FY202 PayPal and ADP had revenue and net income of $21.5B, $4.2B and $14.6B, $2.5B, respectively. 
However, due to its more expanded service offering, it has the potential for greater scale as its adoption grows. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would suggest the company expand its loan business by providing additional loan origination service for car loans, home mortgages, and other collateralized debt offerings.  
Car buying and home buying have increasingly become more contactless similar to Square's initial service offering at its founding.  Companies like Carvana and Vroom are providing car purchasing solely online without the need to go to a car dealership and be forced to use the dealership financing.
Similarly, home mortgages and refinancing have migrated more online with the advent of companies like Rocket Mortgage.  I would also encourage the company to expand its cash app to allow for additional crypto currencies besides just Bitcoin and to be used as collateral for extending credit as they are gaining increasing adoption and legitimacy over the past few years.    

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Square already provides small cash advancements to users (under $1,000) that are repaid based on future cash flows within Square.  Square would be able to earn interest on its loans that would be less risky since they would be collateralized by hard assets (cars, trucks, houses, and cryptocurrencies) not just potential cash flow from its existing users.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
The evolution of providing larger loan origination would utilize the same existing technology offered by Square, it would simply expand its target market.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
The existing technologies utilized by Square are already developed and operate seamlessly, expanding their use for additional services would require limited capital expenditures.
